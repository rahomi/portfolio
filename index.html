        <h2>üìú Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I am a software engineer and I have been working in the field for
          almost 3 years now. My experience includes working with different
          technologies, such as Java, C#, Node.js, Django, Swift etc. I like to
          work on challenging projects and find new ways of solving problems. In
          my free time I enjoy watching documentary/debates or spending time
          with my family. I have a bit of experience with software development
          and I am not that bad xD. I know how to write code for various
          languages, frameworks, platforms and operating systems. I have been
          working on many different projects and have worked with many clients.
          I can manage multiple tasks at once to ensure that all deadlines are
          met. I am very detail oriented and will always make sure that
          everything is done correctly.

        <h3>Sentiment-Analysis of Mobile Operator Customers</h3>
        <p>
          Mobile operators are a big part of our daily life as we use their
          service for almost all of our communications nowadays. However, to
          know whether a particular mobile operator is satisfying their customer
          is difficult as the customers do not have a way to express their
          standings in a unified place. Furthermore, there are a lot of data
          that has to be analyzed. So we will create an interactive dashboard
          that will display the emotions of customers about their corresponding
          mobile operator. We will use an AI that will sort through the data of
          various social media platform. For example- operator Facebook pages,
          public Facebook groups, personal Facebook pages etc. The informal
          language of social media is the first thing to consider before
          performing text mining. The relationship strength between users can be
          guessed on the social sites using their interactions i.e. - wall
          posts, comments etc. by emotion analysis. We have used Na√Øve Bayes
          algorithm for getting our output. We will compare all the result that
          we get and figure out the best method to use to get the highest
          accuracy with our particular case.

        <h3>V2V Communication</h3>
        <p>
          While driving a car, collision detection plays an important role in
          autonomous driving and for the driver. This project presents an
          integrative approach to speed and direction detection which aims to be
          as simple as possible to enable the real- time computation while being
          able to adapt to a variety of highway and urban scenarios on different
          conditions. In this work, we implement a signal-based forward
          collision warning system and an overtaking vehicle detection system.
          The forward collision warning system aims to detect other vehicles
          driving ahead of the host vehicle while overtaking so as to avoid the
          potential traffic accidents. On the other hand, the overtaking vehicle
          detection system is to detect other vehicles behind or on the side of
          the host vehicle so as to give an alert to the driver when the vehicle
          begins overtaking. Experimental results are presented with real scene.
          The performance evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness of the
          proposed techniques.
